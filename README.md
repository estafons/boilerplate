# boilerplate

This cookiecutter sets up a basic python environment. Specifically, it holds the configuration for:

- ruff (linter)
- pre-commit (git hooks manager)
- black (formmater)
- isort (formatter)
- github actions (linting workflow)

In this README you will also find some useful commands.

## Setup Dev Environment

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
on poetry:
```

```
2. Install pre-commit hooks
```

You are all Set! :rocket:
